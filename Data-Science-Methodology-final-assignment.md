# Data Science Methodology final assignment

### Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?

I have chosen as topic for this task the application of data science in the field of Emails.


### Next, you will play the role of the client and the data scientist. Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer.

As A client I would like to filter out my inbox for any kind of spam or phishing emails. The main problem is to datarminate the rules which email is good to read and which is not. So our question would be " Can we automatically determine is email is suitable to read and stored?

According to steps 

### 1. Analytic Approach
### 2. Data Requirements
### 3. Data Collection
### 4. Data Understanding and Preparation
### 5. Modeling and Evaluation

I discribed all aff them:

1. As the problem requires a yes/no answer we will use a classification model.
2. To create the classification model we will require information regarding the known spam or phishing emails rules, acceptance criteria and warning and alerting approaches.
3. We would use techiques like descriptive statistics and data evalution should be implemented in this phase to make sure that we have useful data for our model.
4. In this step we need to evaluate the different variables of our data in order to undestant it better. For example we would calculate univariate statistics, such as mean or median and the correlation between variables. So we need to evaluate the quality of the data. In the data preparation phase we have to prepare the data in an specific way depending on the model.
5. Lastly we create a classification model, evaluate the outcome and perform the corresponding changes untill we have a suitable model.
